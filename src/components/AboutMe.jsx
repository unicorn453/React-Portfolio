      <p>
        Hi, there, welcome to my portfolio page. My name is Kirila Ruseva, and I
        am a Front-End Web Developer. I have always been passionate about
        computer science, which is what led me to pursue a career in UX design.
        I have gained extensive experience in Java Script ES6+, CSS3, HTML5,
        SQL, React, Node, Query, and Bootstrap throughout my career. I have had
        the opportunity to work with some amazing individuals and organisations.
        I am proud to have been accredited with an edX certificate in Front-End
        Development. I am always looking for ways to improve my skills further
        and contribute to the success of my team and organisation. You can
        usually find me in the library when I'm not working, where I like to
        read history-related books and biographies. I also enjoy working out,
        dancing, and spending time with family and friends. I believe it's
        essential to maintain a healthy work-life balance and always make time
        for the things that matter most in life.
